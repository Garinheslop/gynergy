## "The 5 Pillars of Integrated Power" — Free Live Training Promo

> **Version**: 2.0 — Final Shoot Draft

> **Purpose**: Get viewers to register for the free live webinar
> **Placement**: `/webinar` landing page — `WebinarVideo` component

---

## V1 → V2 CHANGES APPLIED

1. Visual pattern interrupt added to cold open (whiteboard number)
2. Specific vulnerability scene replaces generic "I felt empty"
3. Real-life grounding example after the multiplication equation
4. Taste of the Emptiness Equation (not just the name)
5. Third testimonial added (James K. — marriage)
6. 92% stat contextualized
7. Second objection handled ("Is this a sales pitch?")
8. "497 days" used once only (in the promise, where it hits hardest)
9. Emotional callback added to close (bookends the opening)
10. Bridge beat before mechanical CTA instructions

---

## PRE-PRODUCTION NOTES

- **Setting**: Clean, intentional background. Not a studio — somewhere that signals "I don't need to impress you." Home office, balcony, or simple dark backdrop. A **small whiteboard or dark surface** within arm's reach for the cold open moment.
- **Wardrobe**: Casual but sharp. No suit. This isn't corporate.
- **Camera**: Eye-level, close. This is a conversation, not a presentation. **Second angle available** (slight offset) for seamless edits without jump cuts.
- **Lighting**: Natural or warm. Nothing clinical.
- **Audio**: Lav mic or quality shotgun. Clean audio is non-negotiable.
- **Pacing**: No rush. Pauses are power. Let the uncomfortable truths land.
- **Performance note**: Do NOT read from a teleprompter word-for-word. Internalize the beats, hit the key lines, let the rest be conversational. Slightly imperfect delivery is MORE credible for this audience than polished performance.

## THE SCRIPT

### COLD OPEN — THE HOOK (0:00–0:30)

**[VISUAL INTERRUPT: Opens on a close-up of Garin's hand writing "19/50" on a dark surface or small whiteboard. Camera holds on the number for 2 seconds. Then pulls back to reveal Garin looking directly into camera.]**

**[TEXT OVERLAY on screen during the number reveal: "My score."]**

> That was my number.
>
> 19 out of 50.
>
> I'd built $40 million in businesses. I had the exits. The house. The life people congratulate you for.
>
> And I scored a 19.
>
> **[Beat. Lets it sit.]**
>
> If you're a man who built everything and can't figure out why none of it feels like enough — stay here. This is for you.

---

### THE IDENTIFICATION — THE SCENE (0:30–1:15)

> I'm Garin Heslop. And I want to tell you about the moment I knew.
>
> It wasn't dramatic. That's the thing. It wasn't a breakdown or a crisis. It was a Tuesday.
>
> I was sitting across from my wife at dinner. And she looked at me and said, "Where are you?"
>
> And I opened my mouth to answer — and I had nothing. Not because something was wrong. Because I couldn't feel enough to know.
>
> **[Beat. Eye contact.]**
>
> I was winning everywhere that's measurable... and I was gone from everywhere that matters.
>
> **[TEXT OVERLAY: "Winning everywhere that's measurable. Gone from everywhere that matters."]**
>
> I wasn't depressed. I wasn't failing. I was just... performing a life I'd stopped being present for.
>
> And the worst part? Nobody around me could tell. Because the numbers looked great.
>
> Sound familiar?

---

### THE PROBLEM — THE INTEGRATION MULTIPLIER (1:15–2:05)

> Here's what I figured out — and it took me 15 years longer than it should have.
>
> There are five pillars that hold up a man's life: **Wealth. Health. Relationships. Growth. Purpose.**
>
> **[TEXT OVERLAY: Five pillars appear one by one]**
>
> Most of us crush one. Maybe two. Wealth is a 9. Health is a 7.
>
> But Relationships? That's a 3. Purpose? That's a 2.
>
> Here's the part nobody tells you — these pillars don't add up. They **multiply**.
>
> **[TEXT OVERLAY: "9 × 7 × 3 × 8 × 2 = Fractured"]**
>
> When one pillar is low, it doesn't just weaken your life — it collapses the value of everything else you've built.
>
> You close a two million dollar deal and come home to a wife who's stopped trying to have a conversation with you. That's your 9 in wealth being crushed by a 3 in relationships. You can feel it. You just couldn't name it.
>
> **Now you can.**
>
> **Integration multiplies. Fragmentation destroys.**

---

### THE PROMISE (2:05–2:40)

> I'm hosting a free live training called **The 5 Pillars of Integrated Power**.
>
> 90 minutes. You walk out with three things:
>
> **[Hold up one finger]**
>
> **One** — the exact 10-minute morning practice I've done for 497 consecutive days. Not the concept. The actual template. You'll use it tomorrow morning.
>
> **[Two fingers]**
>
> **Two** — your Five Pillar Score. A 2-minute self-assessment that shows you exactly which pillar is bleeding the others dry. Most men guess wrong about which one it is. The number doesn't lie.
>
> **[Three fingers]**
>
> **Three** — what I call the Emptiness Equation. It's a three-variable formula: what you've built, minus what you feel, divided by how long you've been ignoring the gap. When you see your number, you'll understand why success started feeling hollow at the exact moment it should have started feeling like freedom.
>
> This isn't motivation. You leave with tools.

---

### THE PROOF (2:40–3:20)

> I'm not theorizing.
>
> **[TEXT OVERLAY with testimonial card]**
>
> James — built a $12 million company — told me he couldn't look his wife in the eye. After 45 days he came home and she looked at him and asked, "What changed?" His answer: "Everything."
>
> **[Second testimonial card]**
>
> Chris — agency owner, 8-figure exit — said his kids told him: _"Dad, you're actually here now."_ He told me that hit harder than any revenue milestone he'd ever had.
>
> **[Third testimonial card]**
>
> Andrew — serial entrepreneur — came in skeptical. Scored a 23 out of 50. He's now at 41. Not perfect. But his word was: "Alive."
>
> **[Back to camera]**
>
> 92% of the men who completed all 45 days report feeling present again.
>
> Not motivated. Not hyped. **Present.**
>
> That's the word. That's the thing you lost somewhere between the first million and now.

---

### THE CTA + SCARCITY (3:20–3:55)

> The training is **March 3rd at 5:30 PM Pacific**.
>
> I'm keeping it to 100 seats. Not as a marketing tactic — because I actually answer questions live, and I can't do that in a room of thousands.
>
> There's no replay. That's intentional. I want you in the room — not "planning to watch it later," which we both know means never.
>
> **[Leans slightly forward]**
>
> And yes — I'll share how to go deeper at the end. That's honest. But you don't need to buy a thing to walk away with every tool I just described. The 90 minutes stand on their own.
>
> Now here's what I want you to do.
>
> The moment you register, you'll get the Five Pillar Self-Assessment. Take it immediately. It's 2 minutes. Five questions.
>
> The number it gives you will sit in your chest until we meet. Bring it to the training. That's your starting point.
>
> Scroll down. Enter your email. Save your seat.

---

### THE CLOSE — EMOTIONAL CALLBACK (3:55–4:20)

> And if you're thinking "I don't have 90 minutes" —
>
> If you don't have 90 minutes to fix 15 years of feeling empty... that's the exact problem we're solving.
>
> **[Beat.]**
>
> You know what you felt thirty seconds into this video. That recognition. That thing you don't talk about at dinner parties.
>
> It's not going away on its own. You already know that. You've known it for a while.
>
> The only question is whether you keep knowing it — or do something about it.
>
> **[Steady eye contact.]**
>
> Your score is waiting.
>
> I'll see you March 3rd.

**[Holds eye contact for 2 full seconds. Cut to black.]**

**[END CARD (3 seconds): Clean layout — "March 3 · 5:30 PM PST · 100 Seats · Save My Seat" with subtle animation on the CTA]**

## POST-PRODUCTION NOTES

### Text Overlays Needed

1. `0:01` — Close-up on "19/50" being written + "My score." text
2. `1:05` — "Winning everywhere that's measurable. Gone from everywhere that matters."
3. `1:30` — Five pillars: Wealth · Health · Relationships · Growth · Purpose (appear one by one)
4. `1:45` — "9 × 7 × 3 × 8 × 2 = Fractured"
5. `2:40` — Testimonial cards (James K., Chris B., Andrew M.) — staggered appearance
6. `4:18` — End card: March 3 · 5:30 PM PST · 100 Seats · Save My Seat

### Music

- **None** during the first 2 minutes. Raw silence + voice only.
- Optional: Low, barely perceptible ambient pad enters under the Proof section (2:40)
- Subtle swell under the emotional callback (3:55–4:20)
- End card: Clean, confident tone. Not triumphant. Grounded.

### Editing Style

- **Cold open**: Tight edit on the whiteboard moment. Close-up → reveal is one smooth move, not a cut.
- **Identification scene**: Single take if possible. Let the "Tuesday dinner" moment play unbroken. The power is in him NOT breaking eye contact while telling it.
- **Multiplier section**: Can use tighter cuts here — this is the "teaching" moment and pacing can be quicker.
- **Proof section**: Slight zooms on testimonial overlays. Return to Garin tighter on camera for the "Present" line.
- **Close**: NO cuts. One single shot from "And if you're thinking" to "I'll see you March 3rd." The unbroken take IS the confidence.
- **Color grade**: Warm, slightly desaturated. Not polished corporate. Real.
- **Jump cuts**: Use the second camera angle to hide edits. Zero visible jump cuts in final.

### Captions

- Burn-in captions required (80%+ of landing page views start muted)
- Style: Bold, centered, 2-3 words at a time for key phrases
- The "19/50" visual opener must work even without audio — the number alone stops the scroll
- Full subtitle track for accessibility

### Thumbnail / Preview Frame

- First visible frame: Close-up of "19/50" written on dark surface
- This must arrest attention BEFORE audio plays
- Alternative: Garin looking directly at camera with "19/50" overlaid in large text

## TELEPROMPTER VERSION (Clean Script — Bullet Points for Natural Delivery)

### BEAT 1 — HOOK

- Write "19/50" on board. Look up.
- That was my number. 19 out of 50. I'd built $40 million in businesses. Exits. The house. The life people congratulate you for. And I scored a 19. If you're a man who built everything and can't figure out why none of it feels like enough — stay here. This is for you.

### BEAT 2 — THE SCENE

- I'm Garin Heslop. And I want to tell you about the moment I knew. It wasn't dramatic. It was a Tuesday. I was sitting across from my wife at dinner. She looked at me and said, "Where are you?" And I opened my mouth to answer and I had nothing. Not because something was wrong. Because I couldn't feel enough to know. I was winning everywhere that's measurable and I was gone from everywhere that matters. I wasn't depressed. I wasn't failing. I was performing a life I'd stopped being present for. And the worst part — nobody around me could tell. Because the numbers looked great. Sound familiar?

### BEAT 3 — THE MULTIPLIER

- Here's what I figured out. And it took me 15 years longer than it should have. Five pillars hold up a man's life. Wealth. Health. Relationships. Growth. Purpose. Most of us crush one, maybe two. Wealth is a 9. Health is a 7. But Relationships is a 3. Purpose is a 2. Here's the part nobody tells you — these pillars don't add up. They multiply. When one pillar is low, it collapses the value of everything else. You close a two million dollar deal and come home to a wife who's stopped trying to have a conversation with you. That's your 9 being crushed by a 3. You can feel it. You just couldn't name it. Now you can. Integration multiplies. Fragmentation destroys.

### BEAT 4 — THE PROMISE

- I'm hosting a free live training. The 5 Pillars of Integrated Power. 90 minutes. You walk out with three things. One — the exact 10-minute morning practice I've done for 497 consecutive days. Not the concept. The actual template. You use it tomorrow morning. Two — your Five Pillar Score. A 2-minute self-assessment that shows which pillar is bleeding the others dry. Most men guess wrong. The number doesn't lie. Three — the Emptiness Equation. Three variables: what you've built, minus what you feel, divided by how long you've been ignoring the gap. When you see your number, you'll understand why success started feeling hollow at the exact moment it should have felt like freedom. This isn't motivation. You leave with tools.

### BEAT 5 — THE PROOF

- I'm not theorizing. James built a $12 million company and told me he couldn't look his wife in the eye. After 45 days she asked "what changed?" His answer: everything. Chris — agency owner, 8-figure exit — his kids told him "Dad, you're actually here now." He said that hit harder than any revenue milestone. Andrew — serial entrepreneur — came in skeptical. 23 out of 50. Now at 41. Not perfect. But alive. 92% of the men who completed all 45 days report feeling present again. Not motivated. Not hyped. Present. That's the word. That's the thing you lost somewhere between the first million and now.

### BEAT 6 — CTA

- March 3rd. 5:30 PM Pacific. 100 seats. Not a marketing tactic — I answer questions live and can't do that in a room of thousands. No replay. Intentional. I want you in the room, not planning to watch later, which we both know means never. And yes — I'll share how to go deeper at the end. That's honest. But you don't need to buy a thing to walk away with every tool I described. The 90 minutes stand on their own. Here's what I want you to do. The moment you register, you get the Five Pillar Self-Assessment. Take it immediately. 2 minutes. Five questions. The number will sit in your chest until we meet. Bring it to the training. Scroll down. Enter your email. Save your seat.

### BEAT 7 — CLOSE

- If you're thinking "I don't have 90 minutes" — if you don't have 90 minutes to fix 15 years of feeling empty, that's the exact problem we're solving. You know what you felt thirty seconds into this video. That recognition. That thing you don't talk about at dinner parties. It's not going away on its own. You already know that. The only question is whether you keep knowing it — or do something about it. Your score is waiting. I'll see you March 3rd.

| Close                 | Ends on logic (objection reframe)   | Emotional callback to opening feeling               | Bookends the experience. Emotion drives action.   |
