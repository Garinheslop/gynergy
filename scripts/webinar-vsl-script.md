## PRE-PRODUCTION NOTES

- **Setting**: Clean, intentional background. Not a studio — somewhere that signals "I don't need to impress you." Home office, balcony, or simple dark backdrop.
- **Wardrobe**: Casual but sharp. No suit. This isn't corporate.
- **Camera**: Eye-level, close. This is a conversation, not a presentation.
- **Lighting**: Natural or warm. Nothing clinical.
- **Audio**: Lav mic or quality shotgun. Clean audio is non-negotiable.
- **Pacing**: No rush. Pauses are power. Let the uncomfortable truths land.

## THE SCRIPT

### COLD OPEN — THE HOOK (0:00–0:25)

**[Camera tight on Garin. No intro. No music. He's mid-thought.]**

> You built it. The business, the income, the life people congratulate you for.
>
> And somewhere between the wins and the awards and the "you're so successful" conversations...
>
> You started feeling nothing.
>
> **[Beat. Holds eye contact.]**
>
> Not sad. Not broken. Just... empty.
>
> If that landed — stay here. I have something for you.

---

### THE IDENTIFICATION (0:25–1:00)

> I'm Garin Heslop. I built $40 million in businesses. I've had the exits, the lifestyle, the things people chase their whole lives to get.
>
> And about three years ago I was sitting in a house I designed, in a life I engineered — and I couldn't feel any of it.
>
> I wasn't depressed. I wasn't failing. I was winning everywhere that's measurable... and losing everywhere that matters.
>
> **[TEXT OVERLAY: "Winning everywhere that's measurable. Losing everywhere that matters."]**
>
> Sound familiar?

---

### THE PROBLEM — THE INTEGRATION MULTIPLIER (1:00–1:45)

> Here's what I figured out — and it took me 15 years longer than it should have.
>
> There are five pillars that hold up a man's life: **Wealth. Health. Relationships. Growth. Purpose.**
>
> **[TEXT OVERLAY: Five pillars appear one by one]**
>
> Most of us? We crush one. Maybe two. Wealth is usually a 9. Maybe Health is a 7 or 8.
>
> But Relationships? That's sitting at a 3. Purpose? That's a 2.
>
> And here's the part nobody tells you — these pillars don't add up. They **multiply**.
>
> **[TEXT OVERLAY: "9 × 8 × 3 × 7 × 2 = Fractured"]**
>
> That 3 in relationships? It's not just a weakness. It's dividing everything else by a fraction. Your 9 in wealth means nothing when your purpose is a 2.
>
> **Integration multiplies. Fragmentation destroys.**

---

### THE PROMISE (1:45–2:15)

> I'm hosting a free live training called **The 5 Pillars of Integrated Power**.
>
> 90 minutes. And you're going to walk away with three things:
>
> **[Hold up one finger]**
>
> **One** — the exact 10-minute morning practice I've done for 497 straight days. Not the concept. The actual template. You'll use it tomorrow.
>
> **[Two fingers]**
>
> **Two** — your Five Pillar Score. A 2-minute self-assessment that shows you exactly which pillar is bleeding. Most men are shocked by their number.
>
> **[Three fingers]**
>
> **Three** — what I call the Emptiness Equation. The mathematical reason high achievers feel hollow despite having everything — and the simple formula that fixes it.
>
> This isn't motivational. You leave with tools.

---

### THE PROOF (2:15–2:45)

> I'm not theorizing.
>
> **[B-ROLL or TEXT OVERLAY with testimonial cards]**
>
> Chris — agency owner, 8-figure exit — told me his kids said: _"Dad, you're actually here now."_ He said that hit harder than any revenue milestone.
>
> Andrew — serial entrepreneur — came in skeptical. Scored a 23 out of 50. He's now at 41. Not perfect. But alive.
>
> **[Back to camera]**
>
> 92% of the men who've done this report feeling present again.
>
> Not motivated. Not hyped. **Present.**
>
> That's the word. That's the thing you lost.

---

### THE CTA + SCARCITY (2:45–3:20)

> The training is **March 3rd at 5:30 PM Pacific**. I'm keeping it to 100 seats because I actually want to answer your questions live.
>
> There's no replay. That's intentional. I want you in the room, not "planning to watch it later" — which we both know means never.
>
> **[Leans slightly forward]**
>
> The moment you register, you'll get the Five Pillar Self-Assessment. Take it. It's 2 minutes.
>
> The number it gives you will sit in your chest until we meet.
>
> Scroll down. Put in your email. Save your seat.

---

### THE CLOSE — OBJECTION KILL (3:20–3:45)

> And look — if you're thinking "I don't have 90 minutes" —
>
> If you don't have 90 minutes to fix 15 years of feeling empty... that's the problem we're solving.
>
> **[Beat.]**
>
> Your score is waiting. Your seat is not.
>
> I'll see you March 3rd.

**[Hold eye contact for 2 seconds. Cut to black.]**

**[END CARD: Event details + "Save My Seat" CTA overlay with registration link]**

## TELEPROMPTER VERSION (Clean Script Only)

You built it. The business, the income, the life people congratulate you for. And somewhere between the wins and the awards and the "you're so successful" conversations — you started feeling nothing. Not sad. Not broken. Just empty. If that landed — stay here. I have something for you.

I'm Garin Heslop. I built $40 million in businesses. I've had the exits, the lifestyle, the things people chase their whole lives to get. And about three years ago I was sitting in a house I designed, in a life I engineered — and I couldn't feel any of it. I wasn't depressed. I wasn't failing. I was winning everywhere that's measurable and losing everywhere that matters. Sound familiar?

Here's what I figured out — and it took me 15 years longer than it should have. There are five pillars that hold up a man's life. Wealth. Health. Relationships. Growth. Purpose. Most of us crush one, maybe two. Wealth is usually a 9. Maybe Health is a 7 or 8. But Relationships? That's sitting at a 3. Purpose? That's a 2. And here's the part nobody tells you — these pillars don't add up. They multiply. That 3 in relationships? It's not just a weakness. It's dividing everything else by a fraction. Your 9 in wealth means nothing when your purpose is a 2. Integration multiplies. Fragmentation destroys.

I'm hosting a free live training called The 5 Pillars of Integrated Power. 90 minutes. And you're going to walk away with three things. One — the exact 10-minute morning practice I've done for 497 straight days. Not the concept. The actual template. You'll use it tomorrow. Two — your Five Pillar Score. A 2-minute self-assessment that shows you exactly which pillar is bleeding. Most men are shocked by their number. Three — what I call the Emptiness Equation. The mathematical reason high achievers feel hollow despite having everything — and the simple formula that fixes it. This isn't motivational. You leave with tools.

I'm not theorizing. Chris — agency owner, 8-figure exit — told me his kids said, "Dad, you're actually here now." He said that hit harder than any revenue milestone. Andrew — serial entrepreneur — came in skeptical. Scored a 23 out of 50. He's now at 41. Not perfect. But alive. 92% of the men who've done this report feeling present again. Not motivated. Not hyped. Present. That's the word. That's the thing you lost.

The training is March 3rd at 5:30 PM Pacific. I'm keeping it to 100 seats because I actually want to answer your questions live. There's no replay. That's intentional. I want you in the room, not "planning to watch it later" — which we both know means never. The moment you register, you'll get the Five Pillar Self-Assessment. Take it. It's 2 minutes. The number it gives you will sit in your chest until we meet. Scroll down. Put in your email. Save your seat.

And look — if you're thinking "I don't have 90 minutes" — if you don't have 90 minutes to fix 15 years of feeling empty, that's the problem we're solving. Your score is waiting. Your seat is not. I'll see you March 3rd.
