    question: "What exactly is the Date Zero methodology?",
    answer:
      "Date Zero is a framework for integrating all five pillars of life — Wealth, Health, Relationships, Growth, and Purpose. It combines daily gratitude practice with structured reflection, accountability, and community support. The methodology was developed through years of work with high-performing men who had achieved external success but felt internally disconnected.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much time does this require daily?",
    answer:
      "10 minutes in the morning, 5 minutes in the evening. That's it. The morning practice involves 3 specific gratitudes, setting your daily intention, and identifying one gratitude action. The evening practice captures your wins, lessons, and focus for tomorrow. Most men report the brevity is what makes it sustainable.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I miss a day?",
    answer:
      "Life happens. The challenge is designed for real humans with real responsibilities. If you miss a day, you continue the next day. The gamification system rewards consistency without punishing occasional breaks. What matters is the pattern, not perfection.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the live coaching calls like?",
    answer:
      "Each weekly call is 60-90 minutes, focused on one of the five pillars. Garin teaches the core concepts, then opens the floor for hot seat coaching. You can bring specific challenges from your week. All calls are recorded if you can't make it live.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the Accountability Duo work?",
    answer:
      "When you enroll, you receive 1 friend code to share with a man you trust. They get full access to the challenge at no cost. Research shows pairs have 85% higher completion rates than individuals. You'll hold each other accountable through the WhatsApp community.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after the 45 days?",
    answer:
      "You keep lifetime access to the community and your journal entries. Many men choose to continue with our optional Digital Journal subscription ($39.95/month) for ongoing AI-assisted reflection. Others join our annual LVL 5 LIFE mastermind for deeper work.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a money-back guarantee?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Complete the first two weeks — show up, do the work, attend at least one call. If you genuinely feel this isn't for you, we'll refund every cent. No questions asked. We only want men who are ready to do the work.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does this cost $997?",
    answer:
      "The price reflects the value and commitment required. You're getting 8 live coaching calls ($2,000 value), a structured transformation system, and a brotherhood of men at your level. Plus, your investment includes 1 friend code ($997 value) — so you're effectively paying $498.50 per person when you bring your Accountability Duo. The real question: what's another year of feeling disconnected worth?",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is this NOT for?",
    answer:
      "Men looking for quick fixes. Men who think personal growth is \"soft.\" Men who won't be honest with themselves or others. Men who need to be convinced their life could be better. If you're not ready to commit 10 minutes daily for 45 days, this isn't for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is the grand prize winner selected?",
    answer:
      "The grand prize is based on a combined score: 25% journal completion rate, 25% pillar improvement (Day 1 vs Day 45), 20% daily gratitude actions completed, 15% community engagement, and 15% peer nominations. The winner is announced during the Day 45 completion ceremony.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I do this challenge alone without friends?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. The friend codes are optional — many men complete the challenge solo and still experience profound transformation. You'll still have access to the full brotherhood community for support and accountability.",
