# Five Pillar Assessment: Strategic Deep Dive

## The Problem with Most Assessments

Most assessments feel like:

- **Transactional**: "Answer questions, get score, buy thing"
- **Generic**: Same output regardless of nuance
- **Surface-level**: Never touch the real wound
- **Company-focused**: Designed to sell, not to serve

High-achieving men have taken hundreds of assessments. They're numb to them. They know the "right" answers. They've learned to perform even on questionnaires.

## The Breakthrough Insight

**The assessment itself must be the transformation.**

Not: "Take assessment → Get score → Go to webinar"
But: "Take assessment → See yourself clearly for the first time → NEED to understand what this means"

The assessment should create what therapists call a "rupture" — a moment where the defended self cracks open and the person glimpses what's underneath.

## Strategic Framework: The Mirror Protocol

### Phase 1: The Disarming (Questions 1-3)

**Goal**: Build psychological safety while gathering intel

These questions feel easy but reveal everything:

- Decision-making patterns
- Relationship with success
- Hidden shame indicators

### Phase 2: The Excavation (Questions 4-8)

**Goal**: Surface what's been buried

Questions that create the "how did you know?" moment:

- Contrast between public persona and private reality
- Unspoken costs of success
- What they've sacrificed and won't admit

### Phase 3: The Reckoning (Questions 9-12)

**Goal**: Create urgency without manipulation

Questions about:

- Time awareness (mortality math)
- Legacy anxiety
- The conversation they've been avoiding

### Phase 4: The Opening (Questions 13-15)

**Goal**: Plant seeds of possibility

Forward-looking questions that:

- Create vision of integrated life
- Test readiness for change
- Identify their "why"

## Question Design Principles

### 1. Binary Traps → Spectrum Reveals

**Bad**: "Do you feel successful? Yes/No"
**Good**: "When you're alone at 2am, does your success feel like an achievement or an escape?"

### 2. Achievement Language → Experience Language

**Bad**: "Rate your health 1-10"
**Good**: "When you wake up, does your body feel like an ally or a burden you're dragging through the day?"

### 3. Surface Metrics → Hidden Costs

**Bad**: "How's your relationship with your partner?"
**Good**: "When was the last time your partner looked at you like they actually saw you — not the provider, not the success story, but YOU?"

### 4. Present State → Pattern Recognition

**Bad**: "Are you stressed?"
**Good**: "Think of the last 3 times you felt genuinely peaceful. How long ago were they? How long did they last?"

## The 15-Question Assessment Architecture

### SECTION A: THE EXTERNAL SUCCESS (3 questions)

_Purpose: Establish baseline, gather prequalification data, create contrast for later_

**Q1: The Empire Question**
"What's the rough annual revenue of your business/practice?"

- Under $250K
- $250K - $500K
- $500K - $1M
- $1M - $5M
- $5M - $10M
- $10M+

_Why_: Prequalification + this number becomes powerful contrast later
_Report use_: "You've built a [$X] empire..."

**Q2: The Achievement Scan**
"Which of these have you accomplished?" (Select all)

- Built a business from scratch
- Led a team of 10+ people
- Achieved financial independence
- Maintained marriage 10+ years
- Physical transformation (major weight loss/muscle gain)
- Public recognition in your field

_Why_: Builds their achievement identity, creates dissonance later
_Report use_: Lists their achievements, then: "And yet..."

**Q3: The External Rating**
"If a stranger looked at your life on paper, what would they rate it?"
Scale: 1-10

_Why_: Establishes external perception for contrast with internal reality

---

### SECTION B: THE HIDDEN REALITY (5 questions)

_Purpose: Create the rupture — surface what's been unsaid_

**Q4: The 2am Question**
"When you can't sleep at 2am, what thought keeps surfacing that you'd never admit to anyone?"

- "Was all this worth it?"
- "I don't know who I am anymore outside of work"
- "My family would be better off with my money than with me"
- "I'm terrified of what happens when I slow down"
- "I'm performing a version of success I don't even want"
- Other (free text)

_Why_: This question alone creates the "how did you know?" moment
_Report use_: "At 2am, when the defenses drop, you've been asking yourself: [their answer]"

**Q5: The Last Time Question**
"When was the last time you felt genuinely PRESENT — not thinking about work, not planning, just... here?"

- Within the last week
- Within the last month
- Within the last 6 months
- Within the last year
- I genuinely can't remember

_Why_: Forces confrontation with absence of presence
_Report use_: Time calculation of hours/days since they felt present

**Q6: The Sacrifice Inventory**
"What has your success cost you that you don't talk about?" (Select up to 3)

- My health (sleep, body, energy)
- My marriage/relationship
- My relationship with my kids
- My friendships
- My sense of self
- My peace of mind
- My ability to feel joy
- My spiritual life
- I'm not sure anymore

_Why_: Names the unspoken costs
_Report use_: "The hidden invoice of your success: [their selections]"

**Q7: The Mask Question**
"How often do you feel like you're performing a version of yourself rather than being yourself?"

- Rarely — I'm authentic most of the time
- Sometimes — in professional settings
- Often — in most interactions
- Almost always — even with family
- I've worn the mask so long I'm not sure where it ends

_Why_: Directly addresses inauthenticity/disconnection
_Report use_: Mask-wearing frequency linked to pillar scores

**Q8: The Body Signal**
"Right now, in this moment, where do you feel tension in your body?"

- Jaw/teeth (clenched)
- Neck/shoulders (carrying weight)
- Chest (tightness, shallow breathing)
- Stomach (knotted, anxious)
- Lower back (burden, support fatigue)
- I feel relaxed
- I'm not sure — I'm disconnected from my body

_Why_: Somatic awareness indicator, reveals stress holding patterns
_Report use_: "Your body has been keeping score: [interpretation]"

### SECTION C: THE FIVE PILLARS DEEP SCAN (5 questions)

_Purpose: Specific pillar assessment with emotional depth_

**Q9: WEALTH — The Freedom Test**
"Your bank account says you're wealthy. But close your eyes and feel into this: Do you feel FREE?"
Scale: 1-10 with anchors:

- 1: "Trapped by golden handcuffs"
- 5: "Free on paper, obligated in reality"
- 10: "Genuinely liberated"

**Q10: HEALTH — The Vitality Test**
"Beyond the metrics (weight, cholesterol, steps) — when you wake up, does your body feel like a gift or a burden?"
Scale: 1-10 with anchors:

- 1: "Dragging myself through each day"
- 5: "Functional but not thriving"
- 10: "Energized and vital"

**Q11: RELATIONSHIPS — The Seen Test**
"Does your partner/family actually SEE you — the real you, not the provider, not the success story?"
Scale: 1-10 with anchors:

- 1: "I've become a function, not a person"
- 5: "They see parts of me"
- 10: "Fully seen and loved anyway"

**Q12: GROWTH — The Alive Test**
"Are you still being challenged in ways that make you feel ALIVE, or are you optimizing a life you've outgrown?"
Scale: 1-10 with anchors:

- 1: "Coasting on autopilot"
- 5: "Busy but not growing"
- 10: "Actively evolving"

**Q13: PURPOSE — The Meaning Test**
"If you removed your title, your revenue, your achievements — what remains that gives your life meaning?"
Scale: 1-10 with anchors:

- 1: "I don't know who I am without my success"
- 5: "Some sense of meaning beyond work"
- 10: "Deep purpose that transcends achievement"

---

### SECTION D: THE OPENING (2 questions)

_Purpose: Create forward momentum, test readiness, gather contact info_

**Q14: The Readiness Question**
"Be honest: How ready are you to do the work required to change this?"

- I'm just curious, not ready to change
- I know something needs to change but I'm scared
- I'm ready to explore but need to see the path
- I'm ready to invest time, energy, and money in transformation
- I'm desperate — something has to give

_Why_: Direct readiness/coachability indicator
_Report use_: Tailors CTA and report tone

**Q15: The Priority Question**
"If you could only fix ONE pillar in the next 90 days, which would create the biggest ripple effect in your life?"

- Wealth (but not for the money — for the freedom)
- Health (so I have energy for everything else)
- Relationships (especially with [partner/kids])
- Growth (I need to feel alive again)
- Purpose (I need my success to mean something)

_Why_: Reveals their true priority, personalization key
_Report use_: "You identified [X] as your leverage point..."

YOUR FIVE PILLAR SCORE: 27/50

THE GAP PROFILE

You've built a $[X]M empire.
You've achieved [achievements list].
A stranger would rate your life [8]/10.

And yet.

At 2am, you've been asking yourself: "[their 2am answer]"

It's been [X days/weeks/months] since you felt genuinely present.

Your success has cost you: [their sacrifice selections]

Your body has been keeping score: [body tension interpretation]

THE MULTIPLIER EQUATION:
Wealth: [9] × Health: [7] × Relationships: [4] × Growth: [6] × Purpose: [3]
= A life divided, not multiplied.

That "4" in Relationships and "3" in Purpose aren't just weaknesses.
They're dividing everything else.

You identified [their priority] as your leverage point.
You're right.

YOUR READINESS: [their readiness answer]

**SECTION 1: THE MIRROR**
_Reflect back everything they shared with precision and empathy_

"[First name],

You took the Five Pillar Assessment. Here's what you told us — and what it means.

**Your External Success**
You've built a $[X] business. On paper, you've accomplished: [list].
If a stranger rated your life, they'd give it an [X]/10.

By every external metric, you've won.

**Your Internal Reality**
But when the defenses drop — at 2am, when you can't sleep — you've been asking yourself:

_"[Their exact 2am answer]"_

That question has been there for a while, hasn't it? You've just learned to not hear it during the day.

It's been [calculated time] since you felt genuinely present. Not planning. Not optimizing. Just here.

And your success has come with an invoice you rarely look at:

- [Their sacrifice selections, elaborated]

This isn't failure. This is the cost of optimization without integration."

---

**SECTION 2: THE DIAGNOSIS**

"**Your Five Pillar Breakdown:**

WEALTH: [Score]/10
[Interpretation based on score + their answers]

HEALTH: [Score]/10
[Interpretation based on score + body tension answer]

RELATIONSHIPS: [Score]/10
[Interpretation based on score]

GROWTH: [Score]/10
[Interpretation based on score]

PURPOSE: [Score]/10
[Interpretation based on score + 2am question]

**The Multiplier Problem:**

When you multiply your pillar scores together:
[9] × [7] × [4] × [6] × [3] = Fragmented

That "4" in Relationships isn't just a weakness. It's dividing your "9" in Wealth by a fraction. The "3" in Purpose isn't separate from your success — it's hollowing it out from the inside.

You can feel this. You've felt it for a while.

High-achievers like you are brilliant at adding: more revenue, more accomplishments, more proof. But life isn't addition. It's multiplication.

And when any factor approaches zero, it collapses everything."

---

**SECTION 3: THE PATTERN**

"**What Your Answers Reveal:**

You said you feel like you're performing a version of yourself [frequency].

You said the last time you felt genuinely present was [timeframe].

You said your body holds tension in your [location].

This is the pattern of a man who has optimized his external world at the expense of his internal world. You've gotten so good at producing results that you've forgotten how to FEEL them.

The mask you described — wearing it [frequency] — has been a survival mechanism. It got you here. But it's also why you can't feel "here."

Your body is keeping score. The tension in your [location] is the physical manifestation of [interpretation: jaw=held words, shoulders=carried responsibility, chest=suppressed emotion, stomach=anxiety, back=burden]."

---

**SECTION 4: THE PRIORITY**

"**Your Leverage Point:**

You identified [their priority pillar] as the one that would create the biggest ripple effect.

You're right.

Here's why [their priority] is your key:

[PILLAR-SPECIFIC INSIGHT - 2-3 paragraphs explaining why this pillar, for THEM specifically based on their other answers, is the leverage point]

When you focus here first, the other pillars don't just improve — they integrate. The multiplier starts working FOR you instead of against you."

---

**SECTION 5: THE PATH FORWARD**

"**Your Readiness:**

You said: [their exact readiness answer]

[TAILORED RESPONSE BASED ON READINESS LEVEL]

**If "just curious":**
That's honest. Most men start here. Curiosity is the crack in the armor. The fact that you completed this assessment means some part of you already knows.

The March 3rd training isn't a commitment. It's 90 minutes to understand the full picture. No obligation. Just clarity.

**If "scared but know something needs to change":**
Fear is appropriate. You built everything you have by not admitting fear. But this is different. This fear is the doorway.

Every man who's transformed through this work felt exactly what you're feeling right now. The question isn't whether you're scared. It's whether you'll let the fear make your decision.

**If "ready to explore":**
You want to see the path before you commit. Smart. That's exactly what the March 3rd training provides: the complete methodology, laid out.

You'll leave with the exact morning practice I've done for 497 days straight. No obligation to buy anything. Just the map.

**If "ready to invest":**
You're not shopping for a solution. You're ready to move.

The 45-Day Awakening Challenge starts [next cohort date]. $997. Limited to 15 men per cohort. If you're serious, reply to this email and I'll send you the details directly.

**If "desperate":**
Something has to give. You know it.

The men who come to this work from desperation often see the fastest transformation — because they've stopped negotiating with themselves.

The March 3rd training is the first step. But if you need to move faster, reply to this email. We should talk."

---

**SECTION 6: THE CLOSE**

"[First name],

Most assessments tell you what you already know. I designed this one to show you what you've been avoiding.

Your score — 27/50 — isn't a judgment. It's a starting point.

The men who score in "The Gap" (25-39) are often the most successful externally and the most disconnected internally. They've won every game except the one that matters.

You built an empire that looks like freedom but feels like a prison.

It doesn't have to stay that way.

P.S. You said your body holds tension in your [location]. Before the training, try this: three times today, put your hand on that spot and take 5 slow breaths. Notice what happens. That's where we start."

## Prequalification Scoring (Internal Use)

**REVENUE TIER:**

- Under $250K: Awareness stage, likely needs free content first
- $250K-$1M: Challenge-ready if urgency is high
- $1M-$5M: Sweet spot for Challenge
- $5M+: LVL5 LIFE potential, may want direct call

**READINESS SCORE:**

- "Just curious": 1 point (nurture sequence)
- "Scared but know": 3 points (high-touch follow-up)
- "Ready to explore": 5 points (webinar → challenge funnel)
- "Ready to invest": 8 points (direct sales conversation)
- "Desperate": 10 points (immediate outreach)

**PILLAR GAP SEVERITY:**

- Any pillar ≤3: Critical intervention opportunity
- 2+ pillars ≤5: Challenge candidate
- All pillars ≥7: LVL5 LIFE candidate (optimization, not rescue)

**COMPOSITE LEAD SCORE:**
Revenue Tier (1-5) × Readiness (1-10) × Gap Severity (1-3) = Lead Priority Score

Score 50+: Immediate personal outreach
Score 25-49: Priority follow-up sequence
Score 10-24: Standard webinar nurture
Score <10: Long-term content nurture

## Implementation Notes

1. **Time to Complete**: 8-10 minutes (15 questions, some multi-select)
2. **Mobile-First**: Must work perfectly on phone
3. **Progress Bar**: Shows completion %, maintains momentum
4. **Autosave**: Never lose progress
5. **Tone**: Direct, zero fluff, slight edge (matches Garin's voice)
6. **Email Delivery**: Within 60 seconds of completion
7. **Calendar Integration**: Immediate .ics download after results

## The Transformation Loop

Assessment → Sees themselves clearly → Needs answers → Attends webinar →
Gets the methodology → Joins Challenge → Transforms → Becomes proof →
Refers others → Loop continues

The assessment isn't a lead capture tool.
It's the first moment of transformation.

Everything else flows from that rupture.
